 Big Data: Measuring and Predicting Human Behaviour
 ============

# Week 1

University of Warwick [online course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/big-data).

* power of the data lays in the fact that history repeat itself
* insight into a data that you can access free
	* internet data
		* google
		* wikipedia

## Future trend index

* based on google trend data
* difficult to compare between languages
	* simplify to digits search - how often ppl look for previous year
* published in [Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00350)
* critique included:
	* people might not be googling previous years exclusively out of a lack of financial forecast but for sourcing previous academic journals or recent historical events which appeared in the news and are archived on the net, perhaps all done in reference to current research and news.
	* The future orientation index may be a good way to establish if people are planning ahead as this generally includes financial planning
	* Excluding countries with less than 5 million users may limit the results in the context of studying 'Global' internet use. I say this because we may be overlooking something important, growth in internet usage and therefore information gain. According to the World Internet Users Statistics (Nov 2015) Africa as a continent, which is totally excluded (with 330,965,359 users) has increased internet usage by 7,23%. I however understand as said in the paper that Google Trends does not provide information on some of these areas. This may be a limitation.

## What else can we do with the data?

* The opportunities to manipulate Google data to gather insights is verging on infinite. Small businesses can target a geographic or demographic & other criteria to a fine level of detail, managing small marketing spends for example to maximise growth or test & learn. Researching your customer base & gathering insight be it on regional or global level is so easy (more specifically for western culture) which hopefully means research & development can be more relevant & minimise the need for massive business fails due to lack of understanding (marketing, Bridget Credland Dey)
* How do you verify the raw information being drawn from to create data sets is correct, no matter where you are looking? Can we assure the information Google provide?
*  Google data could be useful to predict some trends in society, but related to human bahavior it is more reasonable to think over not about subjects people searching in web, but about purposes they are searching particularly this. From this point , predicting human behavior could become easier, because volume of purposes is definitely shorter than total volume of global search.
* we cannot have just one data source to base our work on. Google been the biggest search engine provider today doesn't mean it's the only one.
*  am interested in who might be left behind in analyses of big data. In future I expect everyone will be connected (wearable tech, the internet of things and all that) but at the moment there are many people whose behaviour cannot be examined through analysis of big data because e.g. they don't Google search the internet, they don't book holidays or do their banking online etc. In the UK and elsewhere, older people are presumably less likely to leave a digital data trail. While analysing big data would seem a useful approach to understanding some of the problems we must face as a society in dealing with an ageing population (e.g. how should be organise our towns and cities, where should services be), the behaviour of older people is likely to be difficult to capture because they are off the digital grid.
* We are at an unprecedented moment in history where human behavior generates ocean of data in which to tap. This is exciting and I am pretty sure there is a huge amount of value to be extracted from these seas, in all domains (energy, health, crime, etc.). Yet, as with any powerful tool, it is not necessarily the tool in itself which is useful or harmful but the way it is used. Big data has to be developed with a clear conscience of its possibilities and possible flaws. Not all correlations mean something. Is the data pool relevant? Is the interpretation of the data correct? Is past behavior always representative of future behavior? Predicting the future thanks to the past is highlighting trends and extrapolating them further, which can be useful, but then what about disruption ? And what about ethics in all this? Do we want for example to live in a world where insurance premiums could be adjusted thanks to IoT captors and big data, calculating your probability to get sick or die? How do we use this potential without ending up in Minority Report or 1984? I am not criticizing or against Big Data (which is already there anyway), just highlighting the need to be careful with it.


## City visibility

* data about
	* infrastructure
	* environment
	* ppl
* [poor vs well off areas visibility](http://urbanopticon.org/)

## Where to get data from

* Data can be obtained from [google][Google_Trends] and [Wikipedia][Wiki_stats]. For [example](https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#geo&cmpt=q&q=Economy+class+flight,+Business+class+flight,+low+cost+flight,+flight+accidents).



# Week 2


* google provides additional filters as it has additional knowledge about searches
* Google Trends normalise search data - each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents, to compare relative popularity. The resulting numbers are then scaled to a range of 0 to 100.
* google is not the only search engine, it is one of the most popular one.

## nowcasting

* big data allows for  faster measurements of human behaviour
	* this removes delay with the standard methods, it might lead to problems yet, see google flu
* correlation examples
	* car part searches related to no of cars sold
	* googling about HK and visit to [HK from this specific country](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2011/ptp.pdf)
* we can use existing pattern to predict future behavior
	* Data is gained quickly while other data gathering methods can be cumbersome as large scale dataset allows us to find more patters
	* for example [predict rankings of item following week](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/41/17486.long),	 as [Sharad Goel](https://5harad.com/#about) shown
* for business
	* predicting proper growth patterns
	* predicting customer behaviour
	* building [client model predictions](http://www.mediaco.co.nz/) or for [climate](http://www.climateprediction.net/)
	*
* there are also [limitations of this use](http://mio.sagepub.com/content/9/2059799115622763.full)

## mobile apps

* [motion sensors informations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARdxlMpCu4o&list=PLEMiIcsJKOBcQfE2kwFY9GU4WzZ0lvJNS&index=9) or other sensors its very easy to extract information about people
	* eye blinks depends on our activity
	* research on bipolar disorder
	* [lumo lift](http://www.lumobodytech.com/lumo-lift/)
* the same thing applies to smart cities - seeing how brain behaves, using smart candles,
* privacy is overated?
* can be used for [health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPXCF5e1_HI)
